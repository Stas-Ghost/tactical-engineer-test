This is a take-home coding test I created for hiring an entry-level developer for Novus back in 2015. The test is in Scala (because that's what we use at Novus), but Scala novices should be able to complete it. You can learn more about my thoughts behind this approach on the Novus Tech Blog, here:

https://tech.novus.com/make-them-prove-they-can-code-and-actually-do-the-job/

Since the job opening was filled and some time has passed, I'm unlikely to re-use this particular test. However, I thought perhaps others might find it useful for interview preparation or just learning Scala. So, I published it to Github.

If you complete the test, by all means feel free to contact me - I'll be happy to provide code review / feedback on your solutions. Pull requests with new test cases / fixes / etc. also welcome!
